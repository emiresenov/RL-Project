# RL-Project

An implementation of DeepMind's Deep Q-Network (DQN) for playing Atari games. The first DQN is modeled for the simpler CartPole-v1 
environment, which was used for testing and evaluation. The second DQN is modeled after 
[DeepMind's DQN](https://www.deepmind.com/publications/human-level-control-through-deep-reinforcement-learning) for playing Atari games.
